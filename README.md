## 🚧 Current Status / In Development

We are currently working on:

- [x] Pagination, filtering, and dynamic sorting via query parameters.
- [ ] Reuse of common query parameters to avoid duplication (in progress).
- [ ] Query parameter validation using FluentValidation.
- [ ] API integration testing.
- [ ] Deployment setup and usage documentation with examples.

This project is under active development, so frequent changes in structure and functionality may occur.

⚠️ This project focuses on backend architecture and features. The UI is minimal and not intended as a showcase.
